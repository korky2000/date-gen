oh boy do i love generators

Hello!

I'm trying to do some front end side projects to build up my javascript skills. Generators are familiar territory so I will be making a lot of those until I get a better grasp on the language. This project was made to help determine what me and my girlfriend will do for dates. Some of them are specific to our home town but can be easily changed. 

This could have been done so much better in PHP but oh well. 

Enjoy, 
KCS
